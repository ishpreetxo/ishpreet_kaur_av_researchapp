friends and family and shop for products

and groceries

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.799
we can run our entire lives from the

6
00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.080
internet

7
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.839
in the same way that an organization

8
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.600
where a business's physical location

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.119
should be accessible for people with

10
00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.080
disabilities

11
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.720
their website should be as well despite

12
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.560
the fact that one billion people on

13
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.480
earth suffer from permanent disabilities

14
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.439
of different kinds

15
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.279
and even more experienced temporary

16
00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.119
difficulties only two percent of

17
00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.960
websites on the internet are accessible

18
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.920
to them

19
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.840
that is why it is so important to design

20
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.200
an accessible website

21
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200
using web content accessibility

22
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.840
guidelines wcag are the documents

23
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.920
explaining how to make web content more

24
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.719
accessible

25
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.719
primarily for people with disabilities

26
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.879
but also for user access methods

27
00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.039
including limited devices such as mobile

28
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.000
phones

29
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.600
these guidelines were developed by the

30
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.199
world wide web consortium

31
00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.879
the main international standards

32
00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.800
organization for the internet within the

33
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.039
past 20 years to provide a single shared

34
00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.480
standard that meets the needs of

35
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.280
individuals

36
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.879
organizations and governments

37
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.600
internationally but why should you care

38
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.760
first it opens you up to an even bigger

39
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.000
audience accessibility is not just

40
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.080
for people with auditory cognitive

41
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.040
neurological

42
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.600
physical or visual disabilities any

43
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.000
temporary disability like a broken hand

44
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.880
or other injury

45
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.640
or age related problems can make it

46
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.640
difficult or impossible to navigate your

47
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.680
website

48
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.600
even a person on the subway who wants to

49
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.360
watch your ad but left their headphones

50
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.920
at home

51
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.360
or people with a poor internet

52
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.360
connection are included that's an

53
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880
awful lot of people who might have

54
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.960
difficulty interacting with your website

55
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.360
or buying your products and services

56
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.479
6.9 billion dollars annually is lost by

57
00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.799
non-accessible e-commerce retailers to

58
00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.799
their accessible competitors

59
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.880
also complying with web standards

60
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.479
enhances performance

61
00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.240
sites that are standards compliant will

62
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.399
run faster work is expected on the

63
00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.399
largest number of devices and operating

64
00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.040
systems

65
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.600
and be less likely to crash what is most

66
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.320
important

67
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.759
they'll get better search engine

68
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.360
rankings finally

69
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.119
it's just the right thing to do

70
00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.119
responsibility and initiative are the

71
00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.318
keys to healthy relationships in society

72
00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:12.080
another important reason for compliance

73
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.520
is the legal aspect

74
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.959
the number of lawsuits based on

75
00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.200
accessibility discrimination is rising

76
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.080
each year

77
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.080
for example in just the u.s there were 2

78
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.840
285 lawsuits in 2018

79
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.879
compared with 814 in 2017

80
00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.760
nike amazon dominoes and even beyonce

81
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.360
were sued for their websites being

82
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.519
inaccessible

83
00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.360
at the moment there are different pieces

84
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.200
of legislation in different countries

85
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.959
that are aiming to make the internet

86
00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.879
more accessible to everyone

87
00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.680
for example in 2005 the government of

88
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.800
ontario canada

89
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.640

organizations including government

93

municipalities

94
00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.879
educational institutions and all private

95
00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.280
organizations with 50 or more employees

96
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.120
businesses non-profits and private

97
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.879

99
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.599
1st 2021

100
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.120
similar laws have been adopted in

101
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.120
australia china india

102
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.680
israel japan sweden the united kingdom

103

the united states

104
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.760
the european union and other countries

105
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.680
today's trends show that compliance with

106
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.840
web content accessibility guidelines

107
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.519
will become mandatory in most of the

108
00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:23.920
world

109
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.239
in the very near future what about your

110
00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.040
