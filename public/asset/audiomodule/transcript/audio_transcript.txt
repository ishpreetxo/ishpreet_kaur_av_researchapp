we use the internet to pay bills

get the latest news communicate with

friends and family and shop for products

and groceries

we can run our entire lives from the

internet

in the same way that an organization

where a business's physical location

should be accessible for people with

disabilities

their website should be as well despite

the fact that one billion people on

earth suffer from permanent disabilities

of different kinds

and even more experienced temporary

difficulties only two percent of

websites on the internet are accessible

to them

that is why it is so important to design

an accessible website

using web content accessibility

guidelines wcag are the documents

explaining how to make web content more

accessible

primarily for people with disabilities

but also for user access methods

including limited devices such as mobile

phones

these guidelines were developed by the

world wide web consortium

the main international standards

organization for the internet within the

past 20 years to provide a single shared

standard that meets the needs of

individuals

organizations and governments

internationally but why should you care

first it opens you up to an even bigger

audience accessibility is not just

for people with auditory cognitive

neurological

physical or visual disabilities any

temporary disability like a broken hand

or other injury

or age related problems can make it

difficult or impossible to navigate your

website

even a person on the subway who wants to

watch your ad but left their headphones

at home

or people with a poor internet

connection are included that's an

awful lot of people who might have

difficulty interacting with your website

or buying your products and services

6.9 billion dollars annually is lost by

non-accessible e-commerce retailers to

their accessible competitors

also complying with web standards

enhances performance

sites that are standards compliant will

run faster work is expected on the

largest number of devices and operating

systems

and be less likely to crash what is most

important

they'll get better search engine

rankings finally

it's just the right thing to do

responsibility and initiative are the

keys to healthy relationships in society

another important reason for compliance

is the legal aspect

the number of lawsuits based on

accessibility discrimination is rising

each year

for example in just the u.s there were 2

285 lawsuits in 2018

compared with 814 in 2017

nike amazon dominoes and even beyonce

were sued for their websites being

inaccessible

at the moment there are different pieces

of legislation in different countries

that are aiming to make the internet

more accessible to everyone

for example in 2005 the government of

ontario canada

established the accessibilities for

ontarians with disabilities act

according to this all public sector

organizations including government

municipalities

educational institutions and all private

organizations with 50 or more employees

businesses non-profits and private

educational institutions

are required to be accessible by january

1st 2021

similar laws have been adopted in

australia china india

israel japan sweden the united kingdom

the united states

the european union and other countries

today's trends show that compliance with

web content accessibility guidelines

will become mandatory in most of the

world

in the very near future what about your

website

is it already accessible
